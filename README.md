# Homicide App - The fictional app for murdering human life legally

The more we create, work with, and use technology, the more we are all collectively becoming more and more aware of how dangerous it really can be. Much like an axe can be used to chop wood and warm our homes – or used to split a person's skull in half, a web server can be used for tremendous good, and terrible evil – whether that evil is carried out knowingly or not.

This website was a small one-day project as an outlet for my anger, and a recognition of how an improper dealing with anger could be used in horrific and completely legal and largely undetectable ways. It is an acknowledgement of the terrible power I hold, and a reminder to my focus on executing my due diligence toward using it for good.
